# Milo constructs a count matrix as input to edgeR. In this matrix column is patient sample, row is neighborhood and values are the number of cells in each neighborhood.
# Neighborhood construction: first it uses KNN to find the neighbors of each cell. Then it subsamples cells, as neighborhood centroids, to construct each neighborhood.

  # Step 4: Computing neighborhood diversity ####
  
  # Milo leverages the variation in the number of cells between replicates (replicate: a set of single cells like a patient sample) of a given condition (liver vs lung mets) to test for differential abundance.
  # They count the number of cells from each replicate (aka sample) in each neighborhood.They use metadata to specify which column contains the sample (replicate) information.
  milo_obj = countCells(milo_obj, meta.data = data.frame(colData(milo_obj)), sample = "orig.ident")     # This adds a m*n matrix, where rows are neighborhood IDs and columns samples (replicates).
                                                                                                        # Values indicate the number of cells from each sample in a neighborhood. This count matrix will be used for DA testing.

  # Step 5: Computing neighborhood connectivity ####
  
  # Milo uses an adaptation of the Spatial FDR correction, which accounts for the overlap between neighborhoods.
  # Specifically, each P-value is weighted by the reciprocal of the kth nearest neighbor (farthest neighbor) distance (the father the kth neighbor,
  # the smaller the p-value becomes after division). To use this statistic we first need to store the distances between nearest neighbors in the Milo object (time consuming)
